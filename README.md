## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

My name is Jawher, and I craft data-driven solutions with Python, blending curiosity, analytics, and AI to solve real-world problems 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI and data-driven projects, including healthcare, agriculture, and rehabilitation.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced deep learning architectures, large language models (LLMs), and scalable data engineering with Spark & Kafka.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects in machine learning, computer vision, and NLP, especially applications that have real-world social or medical impact.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science, deep learning, data analysis, and how to turn raw data into actionable insights.
